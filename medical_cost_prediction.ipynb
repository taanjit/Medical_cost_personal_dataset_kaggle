    "The aim of this analysis is to investigate a range of health-related factors and their interconnections to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance accurately. These factors include aspects such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and region. This comprehensive examination will not only provide insights into the patterns and trends in health insurance charges but will also create a solid base for further research. Specifically, research can be built on how these variables interact and influence the cost of health insurance, crucial knowledge for improving insurance policy design and outcomes in this increasingly critical area of healthcare."
